If you are into movies you may have heard of Jarvis, an A.I. based character in the Iron Man films.

The features that this program would have are:-
1.Recognize spoken voice (Speech recognition)
2.Answer in spoken voice (Text to speech)
3.Answer simple commands


For working of this project properly, we will need (Ubuntu) Linux(though v can run it on command prompt also), Python and a working microphone.


1.Recognize spoken voice
Speech recognition can by done using the Python SpeechRecognition module. 

2.Answer in spoken voice (Text To Speech)
Various APIs and programs are available for text to speech applications. Espeak and pyttsx work out of the box but sound very robotic. We decided to go with win32com.client as::-

import win32com.client as winc1
